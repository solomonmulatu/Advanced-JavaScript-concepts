# JavaScript Advanced Concept
This repository contains some advanced concepts of JavaScript that you may not know or use in your daily coding. These concepts include:

#### Closures:
A closure is a function that can access variables from an outer function scope, even after the outer function has returned. Closures are useful for creating private variables, partial applications, and currying.
#### Promises:
A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Promises allow you to write clean and concise code that handles asynchronous tasks without using callbacks or nested functions.
#### Async/Await:
Async/await is a syntactic sugar that makes working with promises easier and more readable. Async functions can use the await keyword to pause the execution until a promise is resolved or rejected. Await expressions can only be used inside async functions.
#### Generators:
A generator is a special kind of function that can be paused and resumed multiple times. Generators can yield values to the caller and receive values from the caller. Generators are useful for creating iterators, coroutines, and asynchronous streams.
#### Proxies:
A proxy is an object that wraps another object and intercepts its operations. Proxies can be used to modify the behavior of the target object, such as adding validation, logging, caching, or lazy loading.
